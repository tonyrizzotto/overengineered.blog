The Truth About "Full-Stack" Development
</Typography>

<Typography variant="p">
Software engineering is not exactly a science (regardless of what some might say), but it isn't exactly a breeze either. 

For sure we can **all** agree it is not a walk in the park - depending on your path, the profession can be litered with landmines - and even if you knew where to walk, there always remains the preverbial 'rake' that has you seeing stars and brings you back down to earth.

When I got into 'full-stack' engineering, I assumed the experience might be exactly as so many others had preached on places like Medium, Youtube, Stack Overflow, etc. As I geared up to my first job search these... forums ... were my hype. My confidence was tied to their preachings, convincing me I had what was necessary to land a job "right away".

You can already guess how that panned out (**spoiler**: it wasn't so easy), but lately as I've begun to mentor new engineers, I listen to their stories and I'm beginning to understand why.

The Perception of a Full-Stack Engineer
</Typography>

Ask any graduating bootcamp student: "Full-Stack" is a tech-stack that includes `Javascript` and `Python` with something like `Postgres` or `MongoDB` for a database. You deploy your code in a type of CLI interface such as Heroku or Netlify. You're building UI components using 'Material Design' asthetics and your endpoints are RESTful
and follow the expected HTTP-Method conventions we've all come to know and love. 

No.

Full vs. Stack
</Typography>

The truth is 'full-stack' doesn't actually mean anything anymore, except to job descriptions and recruiters. I would argue that there is no such thing as a true 'front-end engineer' anymore. Almost every facet of web-development I interact with in the day-to-day requires deep understanding of what was once the "full" stack. 

Few engineers are able to just pick a niche a stay with it, those how decide to stay hyper focused are happy, but also find themselves limited both professionally and financially. There is almost no work for engineers who want to say on one side of the browser. 

Instead, we have to be comfortable working in a wide range of stacks. Stacks that you can't piece together with a catchy 4-letter acronym with technologies you can't learn about on YouTube or Medium.

{/* When I started out in software development, I just wanted to build things. I had a problem, I had no money, but I had the 
motivation (and the boredom) to try and solve said problem because: "computers are fun". 
However, like so many others, that interest quickly turned into a passion and the itch grew ever more demanding. This was early 2014.

This is an easily forgotten fact, but in 2014 everyone was convinced that web browsers were going to be obsolete in 5 years time.
Mobile phones were all the rage and everyone wanted to build for mobile. Web Browsers were cool and all, but the phone was the device that
held the most potential. They possibly still do, but I'd argue that all mobile phones ever amounted to is 
the ultimate [Gacha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game)

It wasn't till late 2019 that I got <i>very </i> into web development and decided I wanted to purse it as a career. You can probably stop 
and guess how that timing worked out...
